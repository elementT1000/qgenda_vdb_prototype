As healthcare leaders reimagine patient access and care delivery in a post-pandemic world, there is an emerging story around the need to optimize clinic exam room utilization. Better utilization can improve operating efficiency, patient satisfaction, and revenue capture. The 2020 Porter Research study of 100 health system executive leaders identified the many challenges faced today with exam room scheduling, future expectations for optimizing exam rooms, and the impact that proper exam room scheduling can have on a health system\\'s P&L. Increasing Scrutiny on Clinic Exam Rooms With the limited funds available for health system capital expenditures, executives must optimize their existing physical space while simultaneously remaining adaptable to fluctuations in patient demand. In the short term, health systems may experience an influx of patients who delayed elective surgeries, treatments for minor health issues, and preventative visits due to COVID-19. As a result, clinics could be overwhelmed. Patients may experience significant wait times and cumbersome appointment rescheduling. Inefficient scheduling could result in additional revenue leakage, because patients who cannot secure timely appointments at their first-choice location may decide to go elsewhere. In the longer term, executives will need to focus on closing a 20-point utilization gap. Health system executives surveyed identified optimal exam room utilization to be between 80 and 89%. However, 72% of respondents indicated their clinics were operating well under the optimal level. Generally, executives identified a 20-point gap between their clinics\\' utilization and the optimal utilization level. The direct impact to health system revenue can be dramatic. The Orthopedic Director at a large regional health system quantified lost revenue attributable to this gap: \"Our providers see 25 to 30 patients per day, when in reality, we could see 35 to 40 patients. Given our average billing, there is a minimum of $2,000 per provider per day that we are not able to realize due to exam room underutilization.\" 2 Clinic Exam Room Utilization Current 40% 0% 30% 20% 10% <60 61-69 70-79 80-89 90-100 Unsure 5% 16% 34% 22% 20% 3% Optimal Utilization', '_highlights': [{'text': \"Generally, executives identified a 20-point gap between their clinics' utilization and the optimal utilization level.

As health systems return to typical operating levels, it will be important to focus on improving room utilization for the long term. For example, closing the utilization gap means that health systems can increase patient throughput without having to invest in new rooms or buildings or hire new staff. As the VP of Oncology Services at a large health system explained: \"If I can increase my exam room utilization by 20%, given my operational expenses, I could save $200,000 per clinic. With 14 clinics, that means $2.8 million in annual savings.\" While it may take time to fully close the utilization gap, even small improvements are meaningful. At this health system for example, each 1% increase in utilization results in a savings of $140,000 per year that can drop to the bottom line or be invested in revenue-producing activities. This missed opportunity is why 70% of executives surveyed expressed a sincere interest in solutions that close the clinic and exam room utilization gap. 3 Technology Not Meeting the Need Proper exam room management is challenging. This is partially because of process and partially because most health systems do not have access to exam room scheduling technologies that are purpose-built to optimize physical space. Thirty percent of respondents reported they do not use any software to manage their exam rooms and require staff to develop processes unique to each department. Another 20% use Microsoft Excel. The remaining 50% use other technologies that are not intentionally designed for exam room scheduling. \" If I can increase my exam room utilization by 20%, given my operational expenses, I could save $200,000 per clinic.
