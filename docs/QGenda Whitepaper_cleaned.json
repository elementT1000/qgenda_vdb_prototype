        "text": "As healthcare leaders reimagine patient access and care delivery in a post-pandemic world, there is an emerging story around the need to optimize clinic exam room utilization. Better utilization can improve operating efficiency, patient satisfaction, and revenue capture. The 2020 Porter Research study of 100 health system executive leaders identified the many challenges faced today with exam room scheduling, future expectations for optimizing exam rooms, and the impact that proper exam room scheduling can have on a health system\u2019s P&L. Increasing Scrutiny on Clinic Exam Rooms. With the limited funds available for health system capital expenditures, executives must optimize their existing physical space while simultaneously remaining adaptable to fluctuations in patient demand. In the short term, health systems may experience an influx of patients who delayed elective surgeries, treatments for minor health issues, and preventative visits due to COVID-19. As a result, clinics could be overwhelmed. Patients may experience significant wait times and cumbersome appointment rescheduling. Inefficient scheduling could result in additional revenue leakage, because patients who cannot secure timely appointments at their first-choice location may decide to go elsewhere. In the longer term, executives will need to focus on closing a 20-point utilization gap. Health system executives surveyed identified optimal exam room utilization to be between 80 and 89%. However,"

        "text": "As health systems return to typical operating levels, it will be important to focus on improving room utilization for the long term. For example, closing the utilization gap means that health systems can increase patient throughput without having to invest in new rooms or buildings or hire new staff. As the VP of Oncology Services at a large health system explained: \u201cIf I can increase my exam room utilization by 20%, given my operational expenses, I could save $200,000 per clinic. With 14 clinics, that means $2.8 million in annual savings.\u201d\n\nWhile it may take time to fully close the utilization gap, even small improvements are meaningful. At this health system for example, each 1% increase in utilization results in a savings of $140,000 per year that can drop to the bottom line or be invested in revenue-producing activities. This missed opportunity is why 70% of executives surveyed expressed a sincere interest in solutions that close the clinic and exam room utilization gap."

        "text": "\nAs a result, over half of our respondents reported experiencing major difficulties with their current exam room scheduling solutions. Management of exam rooms is considered time-intensive, and the technology is difficult to use and error-prone. The result is outdated or incorrect information and the inability to positively impact utilization. Transparency is also a key roadblock. Executives routinely cite the lack of analytics required to even understand their current exam room utilization. These issues are compounded when each department uses a separate scheduling system, further limiting transparency and a clinic's ability to fully utilize exam rooms across departments. As a result, only 31% of health system executives report being happy with their current solution. This lack of proper scheduling causes unnecessary delays and limits patient throughput. If significant wait times pervade a health system at an enterprise level, patients may go elsewhere for care. To maximize the investment in new processes and exam room scheduling technology, health systems must set utilization targets, measure, and make changes needed to achieve goals. As most healthcare executives agree, clinics should be targeting a utilization level above 80%. Forward-thinking executives are considering investments in process and technology that optimize exam room utilization now. In fact, 70% of those surveyed expressed an interest in solutions that can solve their exam room underutilization challenges"

The most important expected outcomes, as shown in the pie chart, can be generally grouped into three categories: Defined Outcomes from Exam Room Optimization. Implementing an exam room management system will improve clinic room utilization and increase operational efficiencies, enhancing patient access to care and positioning health systems to successfully adapt to the new healthcare environment. Patient throughput will be increased in a cost-effective manner, thereby increasing operating income. Now is the time to take a holistic approach to capacity management and evaluate scheduling technologies that are purpose-built to optimize exam room utilization. In Conclusion. Time is saved and the opportunity for human error, such as double-bookings and empty rooms that result when schedules are kept in silos, is reduced. Unnecessary back-and-forth communication between clinics, departments, providers, and patients decreases. Administrators can collect the data they need to understand utilization trends and address problem areas. The result is that overhead budgets can be reduced or reallocated to more productive services. Patients can access care sooner and spend less time in the waiting room, leading to higher satisfaction and greater likelihood to return in the future. Providers will have the flexibility to see more patients and better allocate their"
