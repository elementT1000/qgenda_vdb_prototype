# A Prototype for Generative Search of a Knowledge Base
This project uses a series of rudimentary tools to create a system that accomplishes some basic goals:
    1. Extracting data from PDF's stored in a knowledge base
    2. Inserting the indexed text daat into a vector database
    3. Querying that database
    4. Using an LLM to provide a concise response


## Prerequisites
- Have Docker installed on your machine
- Set up a [marqo container](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/blob/mainline/README.md)
- An API key for OpenAI (set up in your environment variables)
